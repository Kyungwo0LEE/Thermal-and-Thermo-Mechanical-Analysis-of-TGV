## Thermo-Mechanical Mismatch

The large mismatch in coefficient of thermal expansion between copper and glass (1.8 × 10⁻⁵ /K vs 3.3 × 10⁻⁶ /K) is the primary driver of thermally induced tensile stress at the via–glass interface.

This mismatch governs crack initiation risk
in brittle glass substrates.
