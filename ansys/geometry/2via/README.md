## Geometry 2via

The geometry consists of two copper through-glass vias (TGVs) embedded in a glass substrate.

- Glass substrate: 0.4 mm × 0.4 mm × 0.2 mm
- Copper vias: 0.02 mm diameter, fully penetrating the substrate
- Units: millimeters (mm)

This geometry was used for transient thermal–structural coupling analysis to evaluate thermally induced interfacial stresses and Mode I crack risk under multi-via interaction.
