# Archived Mesh Convergence Figures

This directory contains figures generated during the early stage of the mesh convergence study.

The figures were produced using a limited mesh dataset and preliminary Python scripts, prior to the finalized nonlinear regression analysis.

## Files

- `mesh_convergence_Tmax_v0.png`  
  Preliminary mesh convergence plot showing the maximum temperature as a function of mesh size.

- `mesh_convergence_relative_change_v0.png`  
  Preliminary plot illustrating the relative change in maximum temperature between successive mesh refinements.

## Notes

These figures are retained for reference and documentation of the development process. The finalized mesh convergence results based on an 
expanded dataset and nonlinear regression are available in the parent `figures/mesh_convergence/` directory.
